Project Summary

Created a C++ program that shows 12-hour and 24-hour clocks simultaneously, allowing users to add hours, minutes, and seconds via a menu.


What I Did Well

Implemented modular functions for menu handling, time incrementing, and formatted display.


Areas for Improvement

Improve input validation and adding real-time clock updates would enhance functionality.


Challenges and Solutions

Managing time increments and rollovers was challenging. I solved this by creating cascading functions where adding seconds triggers minute increments, and so on.


Transferable skills

Strengthened skills in modular programming, reference parameters, formatted output, and managing program state will be useful for larger projects.


Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

Code is broken into clear, single-purpose functions with comments for clarity. This makes it easy to maintain and extend.
