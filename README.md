Project Summary

Created a C++ program that shows 12-hour and 24-hour clocks simultaneously, allowing users to add hours, minutes, and seconds via a menu.


What I Did Well

Implemented modular functions for menu handling, time incrementing, and formatted display.


Areas for Improvement

Improve input validation and adding real-time clock updates would enhance functionality.


Challenges and Solutions

Managing time increments and rollovers was challenging. I solved this by creating cascading functions where adding seconds triggers minute increments, and so on.


Transferable skills

Strengthened skills in modular programming, reference parameters, formatted output, and managing program state will be useful for larger projects.


Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

Code is broken into clear, single-purpose functions with comments for clarity. This makes it easy to maintain and extend.

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  Interpreting user needs involves actively listening, asking clarifying questions, and translating requirements into actionable tasks. 
  Creating user stories helps by breaking down these needs into specific, testable features that guide development.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  I approach developing programs iteratively, starting with small, testable components and building functionality step by step. 
  I hope to incorporate Agile processes like sprints, regular stand-ups, and continuous feedback to ensure adaptability and consistent progress.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  Being a good team member means communicating clearly, supporting others, and contributing actively to group goals. 
  It also involves being open to feedback and collaborating effectively to solve problems.

**CS 230 Project: Draw It or Lose It**

**Client and Requirements:**
The Gaming Room wanted to extend Draw It or Lose It from Android to a web-based, cross-platform application. Key requirements included support for multiple teams and players, unique game and team names, a single active game instance, and scalable, real-time multiuser gameplay.

**Strengths in Documentation:**
The design document clearly communicated technical decisions using OOP principles, design patterns, and a domain model, balancing depth with readability for both clients and developers.

**Helpful Aspects for Coding:**
Defining the domain model, constraints, and architecture upfront guided class design, logic implementation, and considerations for scalability, concurrency, and performance.

**Potential Revision:**
The System Architecture View could include diagrams of the three-tier frontend-backend-database structure and distributed components to improve clarity.

**Interpreting User Needs:**
User needs were implemented through scalable structures, unique identifiers, and memory management. Prioritizing user requirements ensures usability, satisfaction, and adoption.

**Design Approach:**
I captured requirements, defined constraints, modeled the domain, and evaluated platforms, tools, and security considerations. For future projects, I would add prototypes, risk assessments, and early automated testing to validate designs.
